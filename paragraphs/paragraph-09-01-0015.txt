Dorothea's tone and manner were not more energetic than they had been
when she was at the head of her uncle's table nearly three years

fall under some new illusion almost as bad as marrying Casaubon.  He
smiled much less; when he said "Exactly" it was more often an

be afraid of him--all the more because he was really her best friend.
He disagreed with her now.
