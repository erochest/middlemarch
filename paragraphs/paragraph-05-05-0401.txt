I should like you to tell me of another landlord who has distressed his
tenants for arrears as little as I have.  I let the old tenants stay

own ideas, and I take my stand on them, you know.  A man who does that
is always charged with eccentricity, inconsistency, and that kind of
thing.  When I change my line of action, I shall follow my own ideas."
